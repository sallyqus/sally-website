I am a PhD student in[ Genomic Medicine and Statistics](https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/courses/dtc-structured-research-degrees/genomic-medicine-and-statistics) at University of Oxford in the UK. I am doing my MSc of Computer Science at GeorgiaTech. I received my MSc degree in Bioengineering under the track of Bioinformatics and Machine Learning from [KAUST](www.kaust.edu.sa) under Prof. Jesper Tegner, and my undergraduate degree in Pharmacy from [](https://www.cornell.edu/)China Pharmaceutical University. 

I have a fervent liking towards data analysis and algorithms design. Always eager to learn and driven by the action of deriving meaningful insights out of large amounts of data, with a specific interest in biological/medical data. I am interested in the nexus of life sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences, including the following: Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Graph Data Mining, Cancer Genomics, AI in medicine.
